# SecurityCamera
A basic security camera made in Python. 

Features include:
- Face and Motion Detection
- Recording when something unusual is happening, and saved into the device in mp4 format (no audio)
- Taking photo of face, and retaking if photo is too blurry.
- Also keeps latest photo even if too blurry when the face isn't detected anymore. When this happens, the name of the photo file will say it
- Some other minimal features such as being able to restart the stream with "r".
